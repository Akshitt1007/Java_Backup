    ========================== Dynamic Stack ==========================

    In a dynamic stack, all operations like pop, peek, and display
    remain the same as in a static (fixed-size) stack.

    However, the push operation is different:
    - In a normal stack, pushing into a full stack results in an overflow error.
    - But in a dynamic stack, there's no need to worry about fixed capacity.

    When the internal array becomes full:
    - A new array (twice the size of the original) is created.
    - All existing elements are copied to this new array.
    - The push operation then proceeds as usual.

    This allows the stack to grow dynamically at runtime — similar to how
    ArrayList or Vector work internally in Java.
