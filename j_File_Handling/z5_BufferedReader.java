/*
    1. BufferedReader is a Java class for reading text from input streams efficiently.
    2. It uses a buffer (a memory chunk) to read multiple characters at once.
    3. This avoids reading one character at a time from the source, which is slow.
    4. Supports reading line by line with methods like readLine().
    5. Improves performance, especially for large input.


    ðŸ§  Summary:
        -> Without buffering: Reads char-by-char from disk/keyboard = slow.
        -> With BufferedReader: Grabs a bunch of chars into memory first = fast.

    BufferedReader Class : BufferedReader(Reader inputReader)

    IT EXTENDS READER. HENCE HAS IT'S OWN read() which is same as InputStreamReader.
        1. The BufferedReader class is used to read text from a character stream.
        2. The BufferedReader class has the same read() method that both InputStreamReader and FileReader use to read a single byte at a time.
        3. The BufferedReader class introduces a method named readLine() which will read an entire line of text which is a huge improvement.
        4. The BufferedReader class implements AutoClosable so we can use the try-with-resources type exception handling.

    To obtain a character-based stream that is attached to the console, wrap "System.in" in a BufferedReader object.
        InputStreamReader(InputStream inputStream)
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

    NOTE : new InputStreamReader(System.in) converts byte stream into char stream.
           AND then br is reading that char stream. Which is what we want!
           After this statement executes, br is a character-based stream that is linked to the console through System.in.
