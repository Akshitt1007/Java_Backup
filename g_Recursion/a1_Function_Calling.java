/*
    How Function Calling Works (Step-by-Step with Stack Trace):

        1) Program starts with main()
            When we run the program, the main() method is the first to be executed and added to the stack.

                Stack:
                - main

        2) main() calls number1(1)
            Instead of closing main, Java jumps to number1, pushing it onto the stack.


                Stack:
                - number1
                - main

        3) Inside number1()
            It prints 1 and then calls number2(2).

                Stack:
                - number2
                - number1
                - main

        4) Inside number2()
            It prints 2 and calls number3(3).

                Stack:
                - number3
                - number2
                - number1
                - main

        5) Inside number3()
            It prints 3. There are no more calls, so number3 finishes and is removed from the stack.

                Stack:
                - number2
                - number1
                - main

        6) Back to number2()
            After number3 completes, control returns to number2, which now also finishes and is popped off.

                Stack:
                - number1
                - main

        7) Back to number1()
            Same thingâ€”number1 has no further work, so it's removed.

                Stack:
                - main

        8) Finally, back to main()
            It finishes execution, and the stack is now empty.

                Stack:
                (empty)
