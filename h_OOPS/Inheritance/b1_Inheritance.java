        Parent:
        - String name
        - int age

        Child1:
        - int rollNumber

        Child2:
        - String subject

    Imagine we have two classes, Child1 and Child2. Both have their own unique properties, but they also share common properties like age.
    Instead of repeating age in both child classes, we define it once in the parent class.
    This way, whenever we need to access Child1.age or Child2.age, it will be inherited directly from the parent class.

            2. but the java compiler makes this illegal
