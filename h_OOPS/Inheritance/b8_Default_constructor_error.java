        num = 10;   // we can't modify here
                    // since A is blue-print

    1. This things will give error since "Class B" also have num as its instance variable since it's inheriting from class A
    2. in class A we have made a constructor for this num
    3. that's why in B we have to make for that num so that it gets initialised
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    class A{
        int num;
        A(){
            this.num=num;
        }
    }

    class B extends A{
        int a;
    }

    1. Here this would not give error since in class "A" default constructor is called
    2. So in class B java will automatically create such constructor in class B for num
       -> Java inserts super() automatically.
    3. But in upper case we have made our own constructor therefore we have to create one in class B as well

    ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways:
    - If parent class has ONLY a parameterized constructor â†’ child MUST call it using super(...)
    - If parent class has a no-arg constructor â†’ child can rely on compiler to insert super()
    - Fields like `num = 10;` must be initialized inside a constructor or block, not directly as a statement in class body
